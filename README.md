# Neumorphic SwiftUI : Neumorphism Soft UI

Neumorphic is a SwiftUI utilities to build Neumorphism Soft UI easily using custom view modifier and custom button style. It supports all shapes. 

Hi, I’m Costa. It is simple to create outer shadow in SwiftUI by writing two lines of code. However, we can’t easily create inner shadow in SwiftUI. That’s the reason why I build this tool to make it simple and reusable.
